</div>

<div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-4 extra one"><p><span>NORTHSEA SURFCLUB<br></span>
A T-shirt for people of the northsea. Everyone who surfs in the northsea is a part of this surfclub. The design is made for Wouter Struyf, a professional photographer. The design was made out of my font 'DING'. It's a simple design, but it totally represents the northsea feeling!</p></div>

      <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-4 extra two"><p><span>AKAW!<br></span>
In this research the interaction between text and image is examined through dynamism and freedom in the theme of surfing. To create dynamism into the images that are collected from existing surfmagazines, several experiments are done. To create freedom, experiments are done on photographed analog images. The research resulted in five bundled booklets which each represent a different stage in a surfsession. Every booklet is provided by a grid to visualize the amount of dynamism and freedom. These booklets are supported by philosophical texts which are written in an existing font and a self-made font. To include the sense of surfing, different types of paper are used throughout the booklets.</p></div>

      <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-4 extra three"><p><span>MEMORIES<br></span>
Departed from existing photos from my birth year (1994) until now (2015), I went back to the places and people whom are presented on these pictures. At the same location, with or without the same people, was made the same picture as in the past. Using a collage technique, the old photo is mixed with the new photo to get an ambience that evokes the memory back. The photos are printed as a postcard and sent to the persons on the photo.</p></div>

      <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-4 extra four"><p><span>DREAMS<br></span>
            In this project, dreams of different people are shown visually, in a collage-technique. People told me their (future) dream, and so i visualized the dream manually, so not digitally. The dream is displayed in color and becomes visible through the abstract shapes in the person.</p></div>
